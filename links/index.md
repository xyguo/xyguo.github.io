These are links to blogs I visit often.

- [Moody Rd](http://blog.mrtz.org): Blog of Moritz Hardt, a research scientist at Google. Mainly about theoretical aspects of machine learning, but the exposition is elementary and the core ideas are quite approachable. 
- [Off the convex path](http://www.offconvex.org): Collections of articles on miscellaneous aspects of optimization methods. Many interesting research directions and open problems. The writings are quite accessible.
- [Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/index.html): More that 1000 articles, covering may aspects of software development.
- [Matt Might's Blog](http://matt.might.net/articles/): Insights about functional programming as well as tons of invaluable career advices for graduate students.
- [Alvaro Videla's Blog](http://videlalvaro.github.io): Distributed system development. RabbitMQ.
- [What's new](https://terrytao.wordpress.com): Terry Tao's blog, mainly about mathematics. Actually I don't understand most of its contents, but for a few that can be perceived, the writing is just great (e.g. the article about [Moserâ€™s entropy compression argument](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/08/05/mosers-entropy-compression-argument/#more-2297)).
- [Computational Complexity](http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org): Lance Fortnow and Bill Gasarch's blog.
